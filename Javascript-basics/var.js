var myName = "abba"   // Var is going to be used throughout the whole program.

myName = 8; 
let ourName = "MyName" // Let is going to be use in the scope of where we declare that.

const pi = 3.14 // Variable that value can never change.

// Javascript is a case sensitive language whicch means the declarations will be different if having same name with differnt case.
// For example :  
// var myName;
// var MyName;   Both the variables are different.
